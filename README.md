# Experimental data
Descriptions of the experimental data from "Estimation of roughness height on oyster reefs".
The velocity profiles for each OR, utilized in determining the roughness height, are organized into .mat file.

## Cell
Rows: Velocity profile for each experimental case 

1st Columns: Experimental case 
2nd Columns: Velocity profile data

## Structure of flow velocity data 
1st Column: Velocity measured level (mm)
2nd Column: Flow velocity (m/s)
